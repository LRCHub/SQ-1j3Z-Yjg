> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
There are things that
you find out sooner
Pretty memories hidden in me
Sadness turns into smiles
That's what I'd hope
Look at the clock
It's turning back
the time to you
I think I'm mesmerised
again and again
Even though "goodbye"
will never go change
Keep you deep inside
my heart forever
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
I think I finally know
(Don't say goodbye)
What comes before
love was sadness though
(Don't say goodbye)
Feelin this love like treasures
in my heart
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
I’m finally learning now
(Don't say goodbyе)
This petal leaf
showering mе above
(Don't say goodbye)
Whenever were up or down, I know
We were so beautiful
There are things that
you only could see when
Darkness turns into light
like the stars
Missunderstanding turns into
shooting stars
My hourglass is turning
upside down right now
Maybe this time my heart
will split into half
If we smile then this
might be just ok
This might be our
happy ending for now
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
I think I finally know
(Don't say goodbye)
What comes before
love was sadness though
(Don't say goodbye)
Feelin' this love like
treasures in my heart
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
I’m finally learning now
(Don't say goodbye)
This petal leaf
showering me above
(Don't say goodbye)
Whenever were up or down, I know
We were so beautiful
When you love,
you'll know how to let go
When you said goodbye that’s
when I knew for sure
I’d let you go
Now I just want to say
goodbye for me
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
My tears are just falling down
(Don't say goodbye)
Just rain over me and
hug my heart
(Don't say goodbye)
I don’t want you to
let me go right now
Day by day (Don't say goodbye)
Someday we’ll meet again
(Don't say goodbye)
Goodbye will turn
into a smile someday
(Don't say goodbye)
Then we'll find out
that what we had
Was something beautiful
(Don't say goodbye)
Doo roo roo roo roo roo
(Don't say goodbye)
Doo roo roo roo roo roo
(Don't say goodbye)
Doo roo roo roo roo roo
